      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        Although I am skilled in several disciplines, I'm more of a dynamic and
        multi-skilled Web Developer and Programmer with a passion for creating
        innovative and eccentric stuff, exploring and experimenting with new
        things, regardless of the brief.
