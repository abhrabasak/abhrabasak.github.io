    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>
      I am a versatile creator thriving at the intersection of technology, art
      and community. I like to innovate through software architecture,
      interaction design and visual storytelling. My approach is rooted in
      systems thinking, drawing connections across multiple disciplines.
